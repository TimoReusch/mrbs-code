# Overview
## Principles
### User interface

MRBS pages can be accessed and used, depending on the user's access level.

There are three levels of access in MRBS:

| Level | Description        | Permissions                                                  |
| ----- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0     | Unkown user        | Can view most pages, but cannot make any change.             |
| 1     | Authenticated user | Can make bookings, and can change their own bookings.        |
| 2     | Administrator      | Are allowed to modify other people's bookings. Also have the ability to add and remove rooms and areas. |

**Authentication process**

1. Before accessing a restricted page, MRBS prompts the user for a name and password. 
2. Then it connects to an authentication server, which is responsible for deciding, whether the user/password pair is valid. 
3. If it is, MRBS then checks if the name is in its list of administrators. 
4. Finally, MRBS grants access to the page at the right level. The name and password are recorded for the duration of the session, and won't be asked for again.

### Configuration

MRBS authentication configuration is done in file `config.inc.php`. This file contains a section for authentication parameters, where several
choices must be made:

- The session management scheme. (How to prompt for a user/password, and how keep track of it)
- The authentication method. (What kind of server will verify the user/password validity)
- The list of administrators (not used by the 'db' authentication method)

!!! tip "Alternative authentication methods"
    There are several alternative authentication methods. They differ by the type of authentication server they can connect to, and by the kind of program used for communicating with that server. Each method is implemented in a pluggable module. There are two general categories:

    - Internal PHP modules, which connect directly to an authentication server. These modules may require additional parameter settings in `config.inc.php`.

        **Supported kinds of authentication servers:**

        - LDAP servers
        - POP3 email servers
        - IMAP email servers
        - NW servers
        - In addition, three special internal modules support a local list of users for one; a local list of users stored in the database for the second; and authenticating anybody for the other.
    
    - External programs, that do the same after being invoked by the special `ext` PHP authentication module.

        **Supported**

        - NT Domain controllers
        - Netware servers
        - PAM servers

## Which authentication scheme to choose
The default authentication scheme is `db`, which stores users' details in the MRBS database in the `users` table.  However, the right choice for you will depend on whether your users are already listed somehere else.

If they're all in a closed organization (eg a private company or a university), then this organization probably already has its own authentication service. MRBS can connect to several kinds of services, such as LDAP servers, NT domain controllers, Netware servers and POP3 or IMAP mail servers.

If your website is using a Joomla! or WordPress CMS and you already require your users to authenticate, then MRBS can be configured to authenticate your users against the existing list of users in the CMS.

## Which session scheme to choose
The session scheme is the way the user and password is queried and recorded.

The default session scheme is `php`.  Some authentication schemes, e.g. 'joomla', 'wordpress', 'cas' and 'saml' require you to use their own session schemes. The others are left in for historical reasons:

## A little bit of history
??? quote "History"

    The original version of MRBS, created by Daniel Gardner, did not have username/password support. Each booking that was made had the IP address of the   client machine logged as the "creator" of the booking.

    In this case the IP address functions as the "username".

    This works well in the case where all IPs are static, and everyone is allowed access to the system. In the wider world there are occasions where this is a  little too liberal.

    To combat this MRBS 0.8 introduced authentication, initially provided by [Sam Mason](smason@mtc.ricardo.com).

    There are three levels of access in MRBS:

    - Level 0 - not logged in
    - Level 1 - Authenticated
    - Level 2 - Administrator

    The administrators are allowed to modify other people's bookings, whereas Level 1 users can only change their own. Administrators also have the ability to  add and remove rooms and areas.

    With time, several alternative authentication methods were introduced. All rely on the same basic principles:

    - Each user is identified by a name.
    - Each name has a corresponding password.
    - The name/password pair must be valid in the authentication service MRBS connects to.
    - Some users have additional MRBS administration rights. Their names
    are listed in the $auth["admin"] list in config.inc.php.
    - It's the web site creator's responsibility to manually enter the names of all the users that will have administrator rights in this list.

    Before accessing a restricted page, MRBS prompts the user for a name and
    password. Then it connects to an authentication server, which is responsible
    for deciding if the user/password pair is valid. If it is, MRBS finally grants
    access to the page.

    The types of authentication servers supported are: LDAP servers; NT domain
    controllers; Netware servers; POP3 email servers; IMAP email servers; etc.

    Still the initial authentication system had shortcomings:

    - The user/password prompt relied on the HTTP basic authentication protocol, in a mode not supported by IIS web servers.
    - MRBS was increasingly used on the Internet, where central authentication servers are not available in the general case.
    - There was no way to log off.

    In MRBS 1.2, the authentication system was restructured by [Jean-François Larvoire](jf.larvoire@sf.net)

    The main change was to separate the user/password acquisition (Also called session initiation), from its validation (called authentication).

    The existing routines for querying the user identity were moved to module `session_http.inc` (now `SessionHttp.php`). This module is left in for backwards compatibility, but deprecated. A new session management module was introduced, based on PHP's built-in session management. This is the one recommended now on. It includes the ability to log off.

    On the authentication side, most existing modules were carried on, with the session code removed. A simple module, auth_config.inc (now AuthConfig.php) was added, managing a simple list of users in config.inc.php. Eventually there will also be another authentication module, using a table of users in the MRBS database.
